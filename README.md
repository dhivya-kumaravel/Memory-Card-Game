This repository contains a super memory game created by using HTML, CSS and JS.
The game has 12 cards in the grid-container, score option and refresh button. Totally 6 pairs...so you should match 6 pairs correctly..
This game will provide you score for the matching cards.
The matched cards will hide and turned to green card to indicate that "matched". You can't click the matched card again till the game to be finished. I've used separate image to indicate that the card is matched.
After you successfully matched the pairs, you can find the announcement that "congratulations...you won the game".
If you want to continue the game, you can use the refresh button to start the game again.
So, while giving refresh the game, the cards will shuffle or re-arrange themselves. 
Here I've used emoji images to match.
